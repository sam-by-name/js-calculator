my reverse pseudo code

first thoughts :
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! what's going on?"

closer inspection:

declare empty variables

when a button is clicked a function is triggered.
sequence of if/if else statements determining what integer 
gets assigned to which temporary variable.



if value is not a number or a decimal point
temp plus equals "value"




equals takes a string and returns the result to the equation inside

equals takes string and turns to and array to preserve order
separate by math operators
loop through array to print index's in order to a variable
let JS do the math and print variable back to calc display
